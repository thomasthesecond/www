# Product Weekly

`product-weekly` is the repo for [productweekly.aptible.com](https://productweekly.aptible.com) hosted
on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

## Running locally

First, create a `.env.development` file with the contentful preview credentials:

```
CONTENTFUL_HOST=preview.contentful.com
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=
```

Then install dependencies and start:

```
yarn
yarn start
```

Sometimes changes you make in Contentful won't show up locally because Gatsby
caches the data. To clear the cache, delete the `.cache` directory.

## Deploying

All commits to `master` will get deployed automatically to the staging site:

[http://aptible-staging.netlify.com/](http://aptible-staging.netlify.com/) 
(password `aptible2019`)

Additionally, every PR will get its own preview build in a staging environment
(the password for PR previews is also `aptible2019`).

**To deploy to production,** after your PR has been merged, push your changes
from `master` to `release`, and Netlify will build and deploy the site
automatically.

```
git push upstream master:release
```

Deploys currently take ~5 mins.

## Adding or editing Contentful entries (blog posts, changelog, resources, etc.)

Log in to Contentful using the shared credentials in 1Password, and make sure
you are in the `Product Weekly` workspace in the top left of the screen.

You can then add or edit content entries. Any changes you make will *not* be
visible in production until you `Publish` them - before that, they will only be
visible locally and on staging / PR preview sites.

Once you publish your changes, you need to re-build the site in order for them
to be visible.

The sites (production and staging) can be built directly in Contentful, using
this button on the right side of the screen when editing content:

Builds can also be kicked off from the Netlify UI, or by pushing changes to
the `release` branch in Github.
